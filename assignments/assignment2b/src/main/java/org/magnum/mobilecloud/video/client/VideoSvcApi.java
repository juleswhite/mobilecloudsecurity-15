 * /**
 * This interface defines an API for a VideoSvc. The
 * interface is used to provide a contract for client/server
 * interactions. The interface is annotated with Retrofit
 * annotations so that clients can automatically convert the
 * interface into a client capable of sending the appropriate
 * HTTP requests.
 * 
 * The HTTP API that you must implement so that this interface
 * will work:
 * 
 * POST /oauth/token
 *    - The access point for the OAuth 2.0 Password Grant flow.
 *    - Clients should be able to submit a request with their username, password,
 *       client ID, and client secret, encoded as described in the OAuth lecture
 *       videos.
 *    - The client ID for the Retrofit adapter is "mobile" with an empty password.
 *    - There must be 2 users, whose usernames are "user0" and "admin". All passwords 
 *      should simply be "pass".
 *    - Rather than implementing this from scratch, we suggest reusing the example
 *      configuration from the OAuth 2.0 example in GitHub by copying these classes over:
 *      https://github.com/juleswhite/mobilecloud-14/tree/master/examples/9-VideoServiceWithOauth2/src/main/java/org/magnum/mobilecloud/video/auth
 *      You will need to @Import the OAuth2SecurityConfiguration into your Application or
 *      other configuration class to enable OAuth 2.0. You will also need to remove one
 *      of the containerCustomizer() methods in either OAuth2SecurityConfiguration or
 *      Application (they are the exact same code). You may need to customize the users
 *      in the OAuth2Config constructor or the security applied by the ResourceServer.configure(...) 
 *      method. You should determine what (if any) adaptations are needed by comparing this 
 *      and the test specification against the code in that class.
 *  
 * GET /video
 *    - Returns the list of videos that have been added to the
 *      server as JSON. The list of videos should be persisted
 *      using Spring Data. The list of Video objects should be able 
 *      to be unmarshalled by the client into a Collection<Video>.
 *    - The return content-type should be application/json, which
 *      will be the default if you use @ResponseBody
 * 
 *      
 * POST /video
 *    - The video metadata is provided as an application/json request
 *      body. The JSON should generate a valid instance of the 
 *      Video class when deserialized by Spring's default 
 *      Jackson library.
 *    - Returns the JSON representation of the Video object that
 *      was stored along with any updates to that object made by the server. 
 *    - **_The server should store the Video in a Spring Data JPA repository.
 *    	 If done properly, the repository should handle generating ID's._** 
 *    - A video should not have any likes when it is initially created.
 *    - You will need to add one or more annotations to the Video object
 *      in order for it to be persisted with JPA.
 * 
 * GET /video/{id}
 *    - Returns the video with the given id or 404 if the video is not found.
 *      
 * POST /video/{id}/like
 *    - Allows a user to like a video. Returns 200 Ok on success, 404 if the
 *      video is not found, or 400 if the user has already liked the video.
 *    - The service should should keep track of which users have liked a video and
 *      prevent a user from liking a video twice. A POJO Video object is provided for 
 *      you and you will need to annotate and/or add to it in order to make it persistable.
 *    - A user is only allowed to like a video once. If a user tries to like a video
 *       a second time, the operation should fail and return 400 Bad Request.
 *      
 * POST /video/{id}/unlike
 *    - Allows a user to unlike a video that he/she previously liked. Returns 200 OK
 *       on success, 404 if the video is not found, and a 400 if the user has not 
 *       previously liked the specified video.
 *       
 * GET /video/{id}/likedby
 *    - Returns a list of the string usernames of the users that have liked the specified
 *      video. If the video is not found, a 404 error should be generated.
 * 
 * GET /video/search/findByName?title={title}
 *    - Returns a list of videos whose titles match the given parameter or an empty
 *      list if none are found.
 *     
 * GET /video/search/findByDurationLessThan?duration={duration}
 *    - Returns a list of videos whose durations are less than the given parameter or
 *      an empty list if none are found.	
 *     
 *     
 * The VideoSvcApi interface described below should be used as the ultimate ground
 * truth for what should be implemented in the assignment. If there are any details
 * in the description above that conflict with the VideoSvcApi interface below, use
 * the details in the VideoSvcApi interface and report the discrepancy on the course
 * forums. 
 * 
 * For the ultimate ground truth of how the assignment will be graded, please see 
 * AutoGradingTest, which shows the specific tests that will be run to grade your
 * solution.
